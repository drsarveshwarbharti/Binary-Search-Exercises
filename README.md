##**Binary Search Exercises**

This repository contains implementations and practice exercises on Binary Search, one of the most fundamental and efficient search algorithms in computer science. 

Binary Search works on sorted data structures and follows a divide-and-conquer approach, reducing the search space by half with each step, resulting in an O(log n) time complexity. 

The repository includes examples in Java that cover both iterative and recursive approaches, along with problem variations such as searching for an elementâ€™s first and last occurrence, handling duplicates, and solving coding challenges inspired by interview and competitive programming scenarios. 

This collection is designed to help learners build a solid foundation in algorithmic problem-solving while mastering one of the most frequently asked interview topics.
